This Repo is to demonstrate behavior change across spring boot versions

To enable this demo please install vault on your local machine: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install
Then run init_vault.sh which initializes a dev vault server.
Only doing this since a back-end is needed for spring config server.

Now can run application in server folder.

I am really just comparing spring boot across three minor patches (2.5.1, 2.5.2, and 2.5.12)

I ran this sample in intellij
